# IZIBLOG

Welcome to your new Jekyll theme IZIblog! In this directory, you'll find the files you need to be able to package up your theme into a gem. Put your layouts in `_layouts`, your includes in `_includes` and your sass in `_sass`. To experiment with this code, add some sample content and run `bundle exec jekyll serve` â€“ this directory is setup just like a Jekyll site!

IZIblog is simple Material Design Based theme for Jekyll blogging...

## Installation

Add this line to your Jekyll site's `Gemfile`:

```ruby
gem "IZIBLOG"
```

And add this line to your Jekyll site's `_config.yml`:

```yaml
theme: IZIBLOG
```

And then execute:

    $ bundle

Or install it yourself as:

    $ gem install IZIBLOG

## Usage

Install the Node Modules to install Materialize Framework and jQuery

- npm install

After that install all the gems
- bundle install

I highly recomend to use Forestry.io as CMS to manage your posts because we already did the hard work for you.
You just have to install the IZIblog theme, push it into Forestry.io and write your posts.

## Development

To set up your environment to develop this theme, run `bundle install`.

Your theme is setup just like a normal Jekyll site! To test your theme, run `bundle exec jekyll serve` and open your browser at `http://localhost:4000`. This starts a Jekyll server using your theme. Add pages, documents, data, etc. like normal to test your theme's contents. As you make modifications to your theme and to your content, your site will regenerate and you should see the changes in the browser after a refresh, just like normal.

When your theme is released, only the files in `_layouts`, `_includes`, and `_sass` tracked with Git will be released.
